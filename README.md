## ðŸ“– About Me

I'm Michael Alf, founder of Beyond The Obvious, based in Cascais, Portugal. With a background from UniversitÃ¤t St. Gallen and certifications in AI ethics and generative AI, I'm passionate about exploring how artificial intelligence can enhance human creativity and decision-making.

Through my writing and speaking, I examine the profound questions emerging from our relationship with AI - from the paradoxes of autonomy in self-driving cars to the positive psychology embedded in ChatGPT. My work focuses on practical AI applications that solve real business challenges while maintaining a human-centered approach.

As a certified High Performance Coach and AI strategist, I help organizations navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, turning disruption into opportunity.
